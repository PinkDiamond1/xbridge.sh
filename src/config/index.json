The initiative is designed to create an ecosystem of platforms and tools for ARK based blockchains (also known as “bridgechains”) with the key focus on decentralized finance (DeFi) and to explore, utilize and combine all the features and the strength of blockchains built on ARK core and close the gap between them. xbridge will develop tools that are comparable to the current demand of blockchain tools.",
